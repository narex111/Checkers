# Checkers
--------

## Description
Checkers is a strategy board game for two players which involve diagonal moves of uniform game pieces and captures by jumping over opponent pieces.

## Rules
Pieces move one step diagonally forwards, and capture an opponent's pieces by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the piece on the first step.

## Design
The interface is designed to communicate an idea that the we are pieces on a board. The frame represents a deterministic nature of both worlds, inside and outside the game. A colorfull checkboard-style background represents the unknown beyond the reality players and pieces of the game can possibly grasp.
